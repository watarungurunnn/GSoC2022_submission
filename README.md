# GSoC2022_submission

## What was done
1. Searched for previous researches and discussed with the mentors and contributors which graph expression and GNN structure are effective for cell tracking.
2. Implemented preprocessing 3D microscopy videos of C.elegans into centroids graph by devolearn.
3. Refactored inference part of the source codes of: Ben-Haim, T. & Riklin-Raviv, T. Graph Neural Network for Cell Tracking in Microscopy Videos. Preprint at http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04731 (2022).
4. Fixed bugs of external modules.
